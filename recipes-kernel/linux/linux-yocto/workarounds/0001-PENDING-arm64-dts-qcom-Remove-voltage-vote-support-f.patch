Subject: [PATCH 1/2] PENDING: arm64: dts: qcom: Remove voltage vote support
 for UFS for IDP

UFS rails have different voltage requirement for UFS2.x v/s UFS3.x.
Bootloader sets the proper voltage based on UFS type. There can be
case where the voltage set by bootloader is overridden by HLOS client.

To prevent above issue, Add change to remove voltage voting support
for UFS rails.
